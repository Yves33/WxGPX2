===========
Rewrote many things from scrath much cleaner code, etc

1 - Internals & Track storage
+ switched from hacked numpy recarray to standard pandas.DataFrame for track object storage
+ gpx parser is now build on minidom (included in python stdlib, and does not require lxml)
+ export and import csv and tsv files, with optionnal compression.
+ dropped support for numpy compressed files.

It should be noted that the gpx specification does not make time tag mandatory
