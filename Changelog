1 - Misc bug fixes  
+ Fit parsing fixes. Based on fit files generated by Canmore Gporter GP102, the program required all fit file messages to have exactly the same fields and to have Lat/Lon entries. This is no more the case and the program should handle suunto (maybe garmin, coros, polar) **.fit* files correcly. Missing fields are linearly interpolated to avoid scipy dependancy.

+ updated to latest matplolib API (```tickparams['right/left'] -> tickparams['top/bottom']```)
+ updated to wxpython API (```deprecated panel.resize()```)


## 2023-12-18 Initial release for WxGPX2
Rewrote many things from scrath much cleaner code, etc

1 - Internals & Track storage
+ switched from hacked numpy recarray to standard pandas.DataFrame for track object storage
+ gpx parser is now build on minidom (included in python stdlib, and does not require lxml)
+ export and import csv and tsv files, with optionnal compression.
+ dropped support for numpy compressed files.
+ the program will reject files missing 'time' information (formerly it used to generate fake times based on a user provided interval)
It should be noted that the gpx specification does not make time tag mandatory

2 - Configuration file
+ configuration is now stored as json with comments. less readable, but far less code to handle.

3 - Map widget
+ now based on PILLOW (GL backend is no longer available)
+ zoom in and zoom out buttons on map

4 - Time widget
+ removed the option for 3rd graph
+ completely rewrote pan & zoom features

5 - Plugins
+ all plugins were rewritten to work on pandas dataframe
+ speedmeter plugin has been rewritten using matplotlib framework (now named gauge)

6 - Scripts:
+ rewrote most scripts. deprecated the remaining ones.
